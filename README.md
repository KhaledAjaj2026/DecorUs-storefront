# DecorUs - E-Commerce Storefront

An e-commerce storefront featuring furniture products that uses React Router for multiple store pages.

## Lessons Learned

Wanted to build a website to learn how to use React Router, as well as styling JSX elements. Enjoyed the ease-of-use that came with React Router. Found SASS variables very usedful for keeping a consistent theme across the site and across pages.

Learned to pass state between React-Router pages via its 'state' attribute. Reviewed separation of concerns concept when styling images and icons. Learned to trust HTML5's inherent responsiveness for compatibility across different screen sizes. Used

## Possible Future Features

- Implement backend functionality for contact form.
- Add CSS animations to images on page load and on scroll.
- Add parallax animation on page scroll for home page.
- Implement filtering/sorting & pagination for shop page.
