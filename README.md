# DecorUs - E-Commerce Storefront

An e-commerce storefront featuring furniture products that uses React Router for multiple store pages.

## Motivation

Wanted to build a website to learn how to use React Router, as well as separating concerns when styling JSX elements. Enjoyed the ease-of-use that came with React Router, thanks to its concise documentation. Found SASS variables very usedful for keeping a consistent theme across the site and across pages.

## Lessons Learned

Learned to pass state between React-Router pages via its 'state/location' attribute. Learned how to create hamburger-menu for mobile/tablet devices. Reviewed separation of concerns concept when styling images and icons. Learned to trust HTML5's inherent responsiveness for compatibility across different screen sizes.

One difficulty I faced was creating an alluring theme that also matched the content on the website: furniture products. Overcame this difficulty by using Adobe Photoshop to sketch out multiple layouts with possible color palettes while using my knowledge in color theory to choose analogous colors for site's theme.

## Possible Future Features

- Implement backend functionality for contact form.
- Implement filtering/sorting & pagination for shop page.
- Re-design cart page to better resemble ecommerce checkouts.
